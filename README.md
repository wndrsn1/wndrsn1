## Previous Projects

1. **Satellite Data Colocation Analysis**
   - Description: A repository of geospatial tools to analyze .hdf and .h5 files from NASA MODIS and ICESAT2 satellites. Currently it functions to determine historical collocations of the two satellites as well as develop visualizations such as CSV and shapefiles.

## Current Projects

1. **Denoising ATL04 Satellite Data With DDPM**
- Description: a repository of pre-processing tools that creates initial training data for a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and then utilizes the model to denoise ATL04 lidar imagery. It is designed with adaptability in mind so that it can be repurposed for other missions.
