## Previous Projects

1. **Satellite Data Collocation Analysis**
   - Description: This repository is part of a NASA research mission to utilize machine learning to detect cloud-aerosol data using ICESAT2 as part of a larger effort to increase accuracy of severe weather mitigation. The goal of this repository is to identify satellites that may provide verification data by utilizing geospatial tools to analyze and visualize hdf and h5 files from NASA satellites. Currently it functions to determine historical collocations of the ICESAT2 and MODIS satellites as well as develop visualizations such as CSV and shapefiles.

2. **Spotify Study Timer**
   - Description: A program to create a virtual timer that will sync with the user's Spotify listening. At the end of the timer, it will pause the user's music, which minimizes disruption to those around them that might be caused by a phone or physical alarm.

3. **Create Spotify Playlists**
   - Description: A program that creates playlists based on the user inputted genre selection as well as the user's liked songs and listening history. It searches spotify for playlists containing the user's liked songs and creates a playlist based on the songs that appear most often.

## Current Projects

1. **Denoising ATL04 Satellite Data With CNN**
   - Description: a repository of pre-processing tools that creates initial training data for a machine learning model and then utilizes the model to denoise ICESAT-2 LiDAR imagery. It is designed with adaptability in mind so that it can be repurposed for other missions.
